The most common SQL Interview Question


Given a table Employees with columns emp_id, name, department, and salary, write a query that will give us the third highest salary for each department

rank, dense_rank, and row_number are all window functions

solve the problem with subqueries

window functions require an over clause in order to do what they need to do

select * from
(select name, department, salary, 
rank() over (partition by department order by salary)
from employees) as ranking
where ranking.rank = 3
;

solve the problem with CTEs

with RankedSalaries as (
select name, department, salary, 
rank() over (partition by department order by salary)
from employees
)
select * from RankedSalaries where rank = 3;with RankedSalaries as (
select name, department, salary, 
rank() over (partition by department order by salary)
from employees
)
select * from RankedSalaries where rank = 3;
