SQL 
1.	Types of commands and their examples.
	Data Definition Language(DDL) : Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate 
	1:	CREATE TABLE employees (
    	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(100),
    	position VARCHAR(100),
    	salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
	);
	2: ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);
	3: DROP TABLE employees;
	4: TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
	Data Manipulation Language(DML) : Insert, Update, Delete
	1: INSERT INTO employees (id, name, position, salary) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Manager', 75000.00);
	2: UPDATE employees SET salary = 80000.00 WHERE id = 1;
	3: DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
	Data Query Language(DQL): Select
	1: SELECT * FROM employees;
	Data Control Language(DCL):Grant, Revoke
	1: GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO 'username';
	2: REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON employees FROM 'username';
	Transaction Control Language(TCL): Commit, Rollback, Savepoint, Release Savepoint, Rollback to Savepoint
	1: Commit:COMMIT;
	2: Rollback:ROLLBACK;
	3: SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
	4: RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
	5: ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint1;

2.	What is Normalization and denormalization?
	Normalization : Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
	Denormalization : The process of combining normalized tables into larger tables to improve read performance
3.	Explain 1NF, 2NF, 3NF.
	1NF : Using row order to convey information is not permitted​
	Mixing data types within the same column is not permitted​
	Having a table without a primary key is not permitted​
	Repeating groups are not allowed.
	2NF : Achieved when it is in 1NF​
	Each non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
	3NF : Achieved when it is in 2NF​
	All the attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key
4.	Share use case where you had to do denormalization in database..
